# casa_pl_perf_analysis

Misc scripts and functions to get performance info from CASA/pipeline
runs, calculate and plot statistics, parse logs, etc.

This has been used for experiments and performance analysis of CASA
and its pipeline(s). Still has too many quick hacks and requires a lot
cleaning up. Use at your own risk.
